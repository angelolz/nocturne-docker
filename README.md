# Docker Container for hosting Nocturne
This repo contains the Docker Compose file as well as the Dockerfile for self-hosting [Nocturne](github.com/usenocturne/).

The version of Nocturne used will depend on what the latest commit is in the `main` branch for [nocturne-ui](https://github.com/usenocturne/nocturne-ui) when the latest commit of the repo was made. *I'm not sure of a better way to do this lol sorry*
